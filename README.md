# Unit Conversion Tool using Microservice via REST API

This is the frontend for a limited unit converter that will convert magnitudes of length, time, mass, force, and speed between various SI, US Customary, and non-standard units.

It is implemented in React and runs locally in a web browser. It relies on a [microservice](https://github.com/MHValdez/CS_361_Partner_Microservice) provided by a partner that was implemented in ASP.NET and communicates via a RESTful interface.

The primary purpose of this project was to demonstrate user-friendly design while adhering to an Agile development process with an outside party.
